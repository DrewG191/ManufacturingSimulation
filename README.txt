File Breakdown and Description:
SimulationV0M - Master file for code, is read to create sub-files for simulating different setups
filewriter - Write simulations with variations in input based on master file
DataDisplay - Read unformatted keyfiles to output a formatted compilation of key information

How to run files:
1 - Run filewriter to create variations of simulations
2 - Run individual simulations in their own command windows (can be run in parallel within hardware limits)
3 - Run DataDisplay to see formatted results for review
